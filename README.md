Many have gone months staying indoors, separated from loved ones, access to limited resources, financial restraints, and so much more. This situation has led to a communication crisis. Communication is not only restricted to socializing, but access to pivotal information, and maintaining a flow in our society that we depend on. This is where COVID Comm specializes in. The outlook is to resolve this communication crisis by entailing services to the public that will keep everyone linked to a multitude of resources so that nobody has to feel alone.
